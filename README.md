Knead Frontend: 

Knead folder stores all the frontend and backend logic is stored in /backend folder. The `assignment` was focused on frontend so i had to do this way :)

- Backend: stored in /backend
  install: `npm i`
  run:     `npm start`

- Frontend:
  install: `npm i`
  run:     `npm run start`

  
I haven't implemented JWT because JWT issuance is handled by the backend, so implementing it separately would be outside the scope. Let me know if you have any trouble running the code. Looking forward to hearing from you guys soon
